Test

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Releases Setup

1. [Create a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) with the name `rust-wasm-test-2025` and push this generated project to it.
2. Enable Actions for the repository, and grant "Read and write permissions" to the workflow [here](https://github.com/PRO-2684/rust-wasm-test-2025/settings/actions).
3. [Generate an API token on crates.io](https://crates.io/settings/tokens/new), with the following setup:

    - `Name`: `rust-wasm-test-2025`
    - `Expiration`: `No expiration`
    - `Scopes`: `publish-new`, `publish-update`
    - `Crates`: `rust-wasm-test-2025`

4. [Add a repository secret](https://github.com/PRO-2684/rust-wasm-test-2025/settings/secrets/actions/new) named `CARGO_TOKEN` with the generated token as its value.
5. Consider removing this section and updating this README with your own project information.
